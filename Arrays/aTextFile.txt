Many of the data types and classes available in Python are actually implemented
using appropriate types from the C language. While Python does not provide the
array structure as part of the language itself, it now includes the ctypes module as
part of the Python Standard Library. This module provides access to the diverse set
of data types available in the C language and the complete functionality provided
by a wide range of C libraries.
